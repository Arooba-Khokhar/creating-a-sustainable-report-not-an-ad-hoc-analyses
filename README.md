# Creating-a-sustainable-report-not-an-ad-hoc-analyses

Task
Treat the assessment as how you would go about creating a sustainable report, not an ad-hoc analyses.

 

This first report version is part of a series of iterations in which the report will be used, evaluated and additional requests might pop up.

 

Loading the data

Use the provided Excel file to load all data into a Power BI file and create the data model.

 

The assessment

We are interested in our sales performance in 2020 and especially how we compare to last year. We would like to see how we perform YTD and how that holds up to the same period last year.
It is important that the sales manager can use a filter (not a slicer) in which he can select the months of the current year he would like to include in the evaluation.
How do resellers and territories compare?
Because we want to grow in a healthy way we would like to integrate the pareto principle in our decision making. What is the share of turnover of our 20 biggest customers in 2020? Who are they and what are some key characteristics of them, is there a pattern?
We strive for an avarage profit margin of 14%
How do we perform in 2020?
What are good opportunities/targets if we want to optimize our profit margin?
